In this DBMS lecture, we covered key topics such as Entity Relationship Modeling, data storage methods, SQL, and advanced SQL like PL/SQL. Recommended literature includes "Database Systems: A Practical Approach" and "Fundamentals of Database Management Systems." The course structure spans levels with topics like Big Databases and Special Databases. Required software includes ER diagram tools (Sybase PowerDesigner, Oracle Data Modeler) and performance monitoring tools like Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Express.
